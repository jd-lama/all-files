                JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting la
                nguage. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
                JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, an
                d a core set of language elements such as operators, control struc
                tures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes
                 by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: 
                    
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Nobis, accusamus!</li>
                <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Reiciendis, doloribus!</li>

            </ul>
            <h2 class="body_head">What you should already know</h2>
            <p class="body_body"> 
                This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Nobis, accusamus!</li>

            <h2 class="body_head">JavaScript and Java</h2>
            <p class="body_body"> 


JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally d
ifferent in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java bu
t does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows mos
t Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes bu
ilt by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a sma
ll number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. J
avaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common cl
ass-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do n
ot have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not ha
ve to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protec
ted, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters,
 and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            </p>
            <h2 class="body_head">Hello world</h2>
            <p class="body_body"> 
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and wri
                te your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: 
            </p>
            <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");
            </code>
            <h2 class="body_head">Variables</h2>
            <p class="body_body"> 
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of
                 variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.

                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript
                 is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the c
                 haracters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. 
                You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some e
                xamples of legal names are 
            </p>
            <h2 class="body_head">Declaring variables</h2>
            <p class="body_body"> 
                You can declare a variable in three ways:

With the keyword var. For example, 
            </p>
            <code>
                var x = 42.
            </code>
            <h2 class="body_head">Variable scope</h2>
            <p class="body_body"> 
                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global
                 variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document
                 . When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a 
                 local variable, because it is available only within that function. 

                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; 
                rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (o
                r global scope) that the block resides within. For example the fol
                lowing code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x i
                s declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement. 
            </p>
            <code>
                if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
            </code>
